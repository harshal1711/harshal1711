🔬 Hi, I'm Harshal - a data-driven problem solver with a passion for building machine learning systems that translate complex data into actionable insights.

I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. My focus lies in applied machine learning, deep learning, and time-series forecasting, with experience spanning across structured prediction, financial modeling, and image classification. I’ve worked on real-world challenges ranging from stock price movement prediction and spam detection to cost-sensitive classification and auction modeling.
